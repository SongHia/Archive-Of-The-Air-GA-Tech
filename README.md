Code for "Calculated Submission", a haptic balloon interface for drifting, and our workshop presentation.

Calculated Submission is a prototype for exploring questions and inherent tensions related to the sublime and sensory aspects of our data set. Inspired by <a href="http://www.aerocene.com/">Thomas Saraceno's Aerocene project</a>.

Team members: <a href="http://mit.academia.edu/BillMcKenna">Bill McKenna</a> and <a href="https://chemheritage.academia.edu/NickShapiro">Nicholas Shapiro</a> (data), <a href="http://www.jessicology.com/">Jessica Anderson</a>, <a href="http://metalab.harvard.edu/people/">Matthew Battles</a>, Song Hia, and <a href="http://blacki.info/">Blacki Migliozzi</a>.

Created as part of <a href="http://humanitiesvis.lmc.gatech.edu/">Humanities Data Visualization</a>, a workshop held at Georgia Tech from March 2nd to March 4th, 2016.

<em>Humanities Data Visualization, a workshop to be held at Georgia Tech from March 2nd to March 4th, 2016, will bring together leading humanities scholars with visualization designers and researchers to explore a range of meanings of humanities “data,” and to prototype new methods for their visual display. Our goal is to encourage these otherwise unlikely collaborators to imagine new forms and platforms capable of portraying the humanistic dimensions of culturally significant data-- an increasingly important challenge in the fields of digital humanities and information visualization alike.</em>
