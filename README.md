# Archive-Of-The-Air-GA-Tech
===============================

Code for "Calculated Submission", a haptic balloon interface for drifting. This was a component of the research and exploration conducted by my team. Our final presentation <a href="https://github.com/SongHia/Archive-Of-The-Air-GA-Tech/blob/master/presentation.pdf">The Archive Of The Air</a>.

Calculated Submission is a prototype for exploring questions and inherent tensions related to the sublime and sensory aspects of our data set and is inspired by <a href="http://www.aerocene.com/">Thomas Saraceno's Aerocene project</a>. The user is invited to watch weather balloon video footage (played back at a chaotic and accelerated speed) and is given a helium filled balloon with AR markers that have been applied. As the markers are recognized by the computer's video camera, playback of the journey slows. This prop was originally intended as a method for engaging with a visualization of atmospheric data.

Created during <a href="http://humanitiesvis.lmc.gatech.edu/">Humanities Data Visualization</a>.

<em>Humanities Data Visualization, a workshop to be held at Georgia Tech from March 2nd to March 4th, 2016, will bring together leading humanities scholars with visualization designers and researchers to explore a range of meanings of humanities “data,” and to prototype new methods for their visual display. Our goal is to encourage these otherwise unlikely collaborators to imagine new forms and platforms capable of portraying the humanistic dimensions of culturally significant data-- an increasingly important challenge in the fields of digital humanities and information visualization alike.</em>
